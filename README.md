# Patient Management Application

This is the application I had to solve as my final exam in OOP at 'Babes-Bolyai' University.

It is in C++, using layered architecture with the Observer design pattern.

It opens a window for each doctor read from the file, and that doctor can see his patients, while also seeing the patients that are awaiting investigation. Updates are seen live on all screens thanks to the Observer design pattern.
